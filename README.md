# Academic Coursework Overview

This repository documents my completed academic coursework during my studies in Computer Science at Uniwersytet Wroc≈Çawski (2023 - present). The following list is organized by semester and includes both core theoretical subjects and specialized practical courses.  


---

## **Semester 1**
- **Mathematical Analysis** 
- **Logic for Computer Scientists** 
- **Introduction to Computer Science** 
- [**Advanced Python Programming Course**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Advanced-Python-Course) 
- **Foundations of Computer Engineering Workshop** 

---

## **Semester 2**
- **Abstract Algebra** 
- [**Programming Methodologies**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Advanced-Ocaml-Course)
- [**Object-Oriented Programming**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/OOP-Course) 
- [**C++ Advanced Programming Course**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Advanced-CPP-Course) 
- **Space Policy and Governance**

## **Semester 3**
- [**Numerical Analysis**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/University-Overview/tree/main/Numerical%20Analysis) (Apart from various smaller tasks done in both python and c++, this folder also contains a larger [project](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/University-Overview/tree/main/Numerical%20Analysis/konkurs1) which uses python to build my own tool to interpolate manually very complex structures - f.e handwriting with extreme precision to just 2D points and then builds the structure itself using polynomials - NIFS3)
- **Discrete Mathematics** 
- [**Game Development in Unity**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Unity-Advanced-Course) 
- [**Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Practices**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/University-Overview/tree/main/Advanced%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20Practices) 
- **Financial Services and Markets** 

---

## **Semester 4**
- [**Algorithms and Data Structures**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/University-Overview/tree/main/Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures) (Apart from numerous theoritical problems solved during this course, I've put 4 bigger algorithmic problems I solved using C++, learning to construct and implement complicated algorithms solving each of these problems and passing all tests) 
- [**Computer Systems**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/University-Overview/tree/main/Computer%20Systems) 
- [**Probability Theory and Statistics**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/University-Overview/tree/main/Probability%20Theory%20and%20Statistics) 
- **Intellectual Property Protection** 
- [**Unreal Engine 5 Development**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Unreal-Engine-5-Course)
